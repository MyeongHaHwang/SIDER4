FORMAT DESCRIPTION
==================

meddra_all_se.tsv.gz
-----------------------------

1 & 2: STITCH compound ids (flat/stereo, see above)
3: UMLS concept id as it was found on the label
4: MedDRA concept type (LLT = lowest level term, PT = preferred term; in a few cases the term is neither LLT nor PT)
5: UMLS concept id for MedDRA term
6: side effectname

All side effects found on the labels are given as LLT. Additionally, the PT is shown. There is at least one
PT for every LLT, but sometimes the PT is the same as the LLT.


meddra_freq.tsv.gz
-------------------------

This file contains the frequencies of side effects as extracted from the labels. Format:

1 & 2: STITCH compound ids (flat/stereo, see above)
3: UMLS concept id as it was found on the label
4: "placebo" if the info comes from placebo administration, "" otherwise
5: a description of the frequency: for example "postmarketing", "rare", "infrequent", "frequent", "common", or an exact
   percentage
6: a lower bound on the frequency
7: an upper bound on the frequency
8-10: MedDRA information as for meddra_all_se.tsv.gz

The bounds are ranges like 0.01 to 1 for "frequent". If the exact frequency is known, then the lower bound
matches the upper bound. Due to the nature of the data, there can be more than one frequency for the same label,
e.g. from different clinical trials or for different levels of severeness.


label_mapping.tsv.gz
--------------------

1 & 2: generic and brand names

3: a marker if the drug could be successfully mapped to STITCH. Possible values:
 - [empty field]: success
 - combination: two or more drugs were combined
 - not found: could not find the name in the database
 - mapping conflict: the available names point to two different compounds
 - template: a package insert that contains information for a group of related drugs

4 & 5: STITCH compound ids, based on PubChem. Salt forms and stereo-isomers have been merged.
   Column 4: "flat compound", i.e. stereo-isomers have been merged into one compound
	 Column 5: stereo-specific compound id

	 To get the PubChem Compound Ids: take absolute value, for flat compounds ids: subtract 100000000
	 E.g. aspirin: -100002244 --> 2244

6: URL of the downloaded PDF. This column is empty for FDA SPL labels, which are available in XML.
	 Unfortunately, many links have become stale since the labels were downloaded.

7: label identifier
